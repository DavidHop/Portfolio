        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>During college I worked as a server at an oceanside restaurant. Since then, I've been working at a manufacturing company while I tried to figure out what career path I was going to take. My girlfriend brought up the idea that I should get into web development since I have such a passion for computers and I am a natural problem solver. I have been self teaching for the past year and decided I needed a bit more structure and guidance. I was refered to CareerFoundry, where I've been polishing my skills to finally make my career shift to a web developer</p>
